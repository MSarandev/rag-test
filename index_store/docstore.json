How to use Buprenorphine\nBuprenorphine should be administered according to national \nrequirements (e.g. under the supervision of a doctor who has \nexperience in the treatment of drug addicts and, whenever \npossible, in centres specializing in the treatment of drug \naddiction).\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nThe dose of Buprenorphine is based on the occurrence of \nwithdrawal symptoms and must be set for each patient \naccording to the individual situation and subjective feeling. In \ngeneral, the lowest possible maintenance dose should be \nsought after setting the dose.\nBefore taking the first dose of Buprenorphine\nThere must be clear evidence of withdrawal before the first \nBuprenorphine dose. If the doctor determines on the basis of \nyour constitution that the time for the adminis  tration of your \nfirst dose of Buprenorphine is appropriate, the treatment \nbegins.\n\u2013 Initiation of treatment with Buprenorphine with an existing \nheroin addiction:  If you are dependent on heroin or  \na short-acting opioid, you should take your first dose of \nBuprenorphine at the first clear signs of withdrawal \nsymptoms, but no earlier than 6 hours after the last opioid \nuse.\n\u2013 Initiation of treatment with Buprenorphine with an existing \nmethadone addiction:  If you are already on methadone or \na long-acting opioid, the dose of methadone should \nideally be reduced to below 30 mg/day before starting \nBuprenorphine treatment. The first dose of Buprenorphine \nshould be used at the first definite withdrawal symptoms, \nbut at the earliest 24 hours after the last dose of \nmethadone. At high doses of methadone, a longer \nwaiting period may be necessary.\nInitiation of treatment\nWhen you are ready to start treatment, the doctor will \ndetermine the appropriate starting dose for you according to \nyour needs. The aim of treatment is to determine the dose \nthat prevents the onset of with  drawal symptoms in order to \navoid the use of illegal opioids. Please tell your doctor \nhonestly, what dose of Buprenorphine suppresses your \nwithdrawal symptoms, and tell your doctor if you think the \neffect of Buprenorphine is too strong or too weak. Drowsiness \nand sedation are not the goal of the treatment.\nStabilisation and maintenance therapy\nYour doctor can adjust the dose according to your needs in \nthe days following the start of treatment. For many patients, \nthe daily dose ranges from 12 to 16 mg buprenorphine once \ndaily and should not exceed 24 mg per day.\nAlternate dosing\nThe clinical effectiveness of Buprenorphine can last 48 to  \n72 hours depending on the dose. Therefore, after you have \nreached a stable dose of buprenorphine, your doctor may \nalternately give you double the dose for a 2-day interval or \ntriple the dose for a 3-day interval. The dose setting must be \ncarried out under medical supervision. While setting the \ndouble or triple dose, you are monitored for 3\u20134 hours for \npossible overdose symptoms. Before increasing the \nbuprenorphine dose, the use of other central depressant \nsubstances (e.g. benzodiazepines) must be excluded. \nOptimized doses are to be used individually. In individual \ncases, lower doses may be sufficient.\nSigns and symptoms of excessive buprenorphine use\nSigns and symptoms of excessive buprenorphine effects \ninclude symptoms such as \u201cfeeling strange\u201d, poor \nconcentration, sleepiness and possibly standing up.

Your GP \nwill urgently refer you to your specialist.  \n\u2022 Valproate carries a risk if taken during pregnancy. The higher the dose, the higher the risks \nbut all doses carry a risk , including when valproate is used in combination with other \nmedicines to treat epilepsy . \n\u2022 It can cause serious birth defects and can affect the physical and mental development of the \nchild as it grows  after birth and may lead to permanent disability . If you take valproate during \npregnancy, you have a higher risk than other women of having a child with birth defects that \nrequire medical treatment. Because valproate has been used for many years , we know that \nin women who take valproate around 11 babies in every 100 will have birth defects. This compares to 2 to 3 babies in every 100 born to women from the general population.  \n- The most frequently reported birth defects include spina bifida (where the bones of the \nspine are not properly developed); facial and skull malformations; heart, kidney, urinary tract and sexual organ malformations; limb defects  and multiple associated \nmalformations affecting several organs and parts of the body. Birth defects may result in \ndisabilities which may be severe  and/or permanent .  \n- Hearing problems or deafness have been reported in children exposed to valproate \nduring pregnancy.  \n- Eye malformations have been reported in children exposed to valproate during \npregnancy in association with other congenital malformations. These eye malformations \nmay affect vision.  \n\u2022 It is estimated that up to 30- 40% of preschool children whose mothers took valproate during \npregnancy may have problems with early childhood development. Children affected can be slow to walk and talk, intellectually less able than other children, and have difficulty with \nlanguage and memory.  \n- Autistic spectrum disorders are more often diagnosed in children exposed to valproate \nand there is some evidence children may be more likely to develop symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  \n\u2022 Before prescribing this medicine to you, two specialists will have agreed that your condition \ndoes not respond to other treatments and the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks,  and \nyour specialist s will have explained what might happen to your baby if you become pregnant \nwhilst taking valproate.  \n\u2022 If you decide later you want to have a baby you must not stop taking your medicine or your \nmethod of contraception until you have discussed this with your specialist .  \n\u2022 If you are a parent or a caregiver of a female child treated with valproate, you must  contact \ntheir GP  once your child using valproate experiences their first period ( menarche) . Their GP \nwill refer your child to their specialist who  will decide with another specialist whether \nvalproate is the only possible treatment or whether another medicine should be prescribed.  \n\u2022 Some birth control pills (oestrogen -containing birth control pills) may lower valproate levels \nin your blood. Make sure you talk to your GP, specialist or sexual health and contraception \nclinic  about the method of birth control (contraception) that is the most appropriate for you.  \n\u2022 Ask your specialist  about taking folic acid when trying for a baby. Folic acid can lower the \ngeneral risk of spina bifida and early miscarriage that exists with all pregnancies.

At plasma \nconcentrations of up to 5 to 6 times the maximum therapeutic levels, there are unlikely to be any \nsymptoms other than nausea, vomiting and dizziness.  \n Signs of acute massive overdose, i.e. plasma concentration 10 \u2013 20 times maximum therapeutic \nlevels, usually include CNS depression or coma with muscular hypotonia, hyporeflexia, miosis, \nimpaired respiratory function, metabolic acidosis, hypotension and circulatory collapse/shock. A \nfavourable outcome is usual. However, some deaths have occurred following massive \noverdose.  \n However, the symptoms may be variable and seizures have been reported in the presence of \nvery high plasma levels in patients with epilepsy  (see section 5.2). Cases of intracranial \nhypertension related to cerebral oedema have been reported.  \n \nThe presence of sodium content in the Epival CR formulations may lead to hypernatraemia \nwhen taken in overdose.   \n \nManagement  \nHospital m anagement of overdose should be symptomatic, including cardio- respirato- gastric \nmonitoring. Gastric lavage may be useful up to 10 to 12 hours following ingestion.  \n In case of valproate overdose resulting in hyperammonaemia, carnitine can be given through IV \nroute to attempt to normalize ammonia levels.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 2481, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator":
